# COVID19 Data Analylsis
This repository contains date reted to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The data is soruced from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/).

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis came directly from the JHU CSSE repository. The specific datasets being used are [time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv) and [time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv) filesm which contains the time-series data of COVID-19 cases.

## Data Preparation
In Tableau, the data was manipulated to pivot the dates columns and obtain a date column and a cases column. This transformation makes it easier to analyze and visulaize how COVID-19 cases change over time.

## Analysis
The analysis in this project covers several areas:
- Trend analysis of confirmed and death cases over time.
- State-wise comparison of cases for the years 2020 to 2023.
- Caluculation and visualization of the mortality rate.

## Visualizations
This Tableau project aims to provide insights into the progression and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic across various regions over a span of three years. The visualizations offer a comprehensive understanding of the effects of the pandemic.
1. **Compraison Line Graph ([Confirmed and Death Cases Over Time](https://github.com/wenxie65/COVID19-Data-Analylsis/blob/main/visualizations/Cases%20vs.%20Date.png)):** The comparison line graph illustrates the trend in confirmed and death cases over time from January 2020 to March 2023. In early 2020, when the pandemic emerged, both confirmed and death cases started at relatively low levels. However, by March 2020, confirmed cases surged dramatically, peaking at over 20 million by April 2020, while death cases also saw a significant increase. Notably, around January 2021, there was a substantial jump in both confirmed and death cases. Moreover, there is a noticeable downturn in cases around February 2023, potentially due to a significant portion of the population might have acquired immunity, leading to a decrease in the number of new cases.
2. **[Mortality Rate Over Time](https://github.com/wenxie65/COVID19-Data-Analylsis/blob/main/visualizations/Mortality%20Rate%20vs.%20Date.png):** The graph illustrates the changes in the mortality rate from January 2020 to March 2023. In early 2020, the rate was notably high, standing at 24%. Fortunately, as time progressed, the rate experienced a significant decrease, reaching 2% by March 2020. Throughout 2020, the rate ranged between 2% and 6%. These fluctuations could potentially be due to variations in healthcare and societal responses. Starting from January 2021, the rate remained constant at 2%, maintaining this lower level throughout 2022 and 2023. The consistent 1% rate from January 2022 onwards indicates the improvement in managing COVID-19 outcomes.
3. **Comparison Bar Graph ([Confirmed Cases and Deaths in 2020](https://github.com/wenxie65/COVID19-Data-Analylsis/blob/main/visualizations/Cases%20vs.%20State%202020.png)):** The bar graphs compare the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths across various states and territories in the year 2020. States such as California, Florida, New York and Texas had the highest counts of confirmed cases and deaths. The graphs illustrate the significant variations in the impacts of the pandemic varied greatly across different regions.
4. **Comparison Bar Graph ([Confirmed Cases and Deaths in 2021](https://github.com/wenxie65/COVID19-Data-Analylsis/blob/main/visualizations/Cases%20vs.%20State%202021.png)):** The comparison bar graph illustrates the count of COVID-19 cases and deaths in various states and territories during the year 2021. Similar to 2020, states like California, Florida, New York, and Texas had the highest numbers of cases and deaths. The graph highlights the persistent challenges posed by the pandemic across different regions.
5. **Comparison Bar Graph ([Confirmed Cases and Deaths in 2022](https://github.com/wenxie65/COVID19-Data-Analylsis/blob/main/visualizations/Cases%20vs.%20State%202022.png)):** The comparison bar graph shows the COVID-19 statistics for the year 2022 across different states and territories. States such as California, Florida, Texas, and New York have reported high numbers of both confirmed cases and deaths, consistent with previous years. The data highlights the continued impact of the pandemic.
6. **Comparison Bar Graph ([Confirmed Cases and Deaths in 2023](https://github.com/wenxie65/COVID19-Data-Analylsis/blob/main/visualizations/Cases%20vs.%20State%202023.png)):** The comparison bar graph shows the COVID-19 statistics for the year 2023 across various states and territories. California, Florida, New York, and Texas continue to report significant numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, although these figures are lower than in previous years. The data highlights changes in the impacts of the pandemic in different regions.
