# COVID19 Data Analylsis
This repository contains date reted to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The data is soruced from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/).

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis came directly from the JHU CSSE repository. The specific datasets being used are [time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv) and [time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv) filesm which contains the time-series data of COVID-19 cases.

## Data Preparation
In Tableau, the data was manipulated to pivot the dates columns and obtain a date column and a cases column. This transformation makes it easier to analyze and visulaize how COVID-19 cases change over time.

## Analysis
The analysis in this project covers several areas:
- Trend analysis of confirmed and death cases over time.
- State-wise comparison of cases for the years 2020 to 2023.
- Caluculation and visualization of the mortality rate.
